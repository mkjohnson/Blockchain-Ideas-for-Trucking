# Blockchain-Ideas-for-Trucking

I have been working on blockchain use-cases in my head for 5 years now. I started this repository to put them into words. Most of this is just theory and concepts I have been thinking about. This list will grow quickly as I transcribe some of my ramblings I record during my daily commute. Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress, there is no code here, and I welcome any feedback, positive or negative. 

- [Proof-of-Transport](https://github.com/mkjohnson/Blockchain-Ideas-for-Trucking/blob/master/Proof-of-Transport.md) - a self-permissioning, self-regulating Proof-of-Work concept

- [DDSAP](https://github.com/mkjohnson/Blockchain-Ideas-for-Trucking/blob/master/DDSAP.md) - Decentralized Data Standards Adoption Protocol - Preventing the "EDI-ification" of the blockchain

- [Mesh Networkng](https://github.com/mkjohnson/Blockchain-Ideas-for-Trucking/blob/master/Tractor%20Mesh.md) - Using trucks and trailers as a mesh network to bypass cellular data use

I am going to keep expanding and refining these concepts, as well as adding some more use-cases I have in my head. More to come soon!
