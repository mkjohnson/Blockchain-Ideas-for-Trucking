There are almost 2 million semi tractors in the US alone. I'd bet that if we created a dynamic mesh network of relays in tractors with uplinks to the internet through rest areas, weigh stations, and truck stops, that we could not only provide for our own connectivity needs as an industry, we could resell connectivity to the internet as an alternative to cellular data networks to regular consumers. If we include trailers as relays, the number increases to 8 million. There are only 215,000 cell phone towers in the US.

Hmm...
