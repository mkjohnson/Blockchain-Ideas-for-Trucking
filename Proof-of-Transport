To acheive consensus using a Proof-of-Work model and not have an "arms race" in hash power on the network,I propose a system where block solutions are only valid while the truck is dispatched on a load and moving. This prevents gaming of the system and keeps the hash rate in check. It also scales naturally with the economy: more transport = better economy = more hashing power on the network to handle the load. Brokerages would essentially rent the hashpower of the trucks the carrier owns while hauling a brokered load. 

Every blockchain needs a base token. A chain's base token is normally distributed via block rewards. By assigning a "cost" to every transaction on the network, a malicious actor could not flood the blockchain with useless transactions (spam). These base tokens have more uses that I will expand upon in another document.

To prevent a malicious actor from just adding extra hash power to the network in order to perform a 51% attack, the fact that block solutions will only be accepted by the other nodes if they come from a valid tractor (will expand upon identity management in another piece) and the nodes of both the shipper and receiver agree that the tractor is actually hauling a load. This secures the chain by making it more beneficial to actually just haul loads legitimately than to try and cheat by buying tractors, creating fake shippers and receivers, creating fake orders, then having to move the trucks from origin to destination to pull off a successfull double-spend attack.
