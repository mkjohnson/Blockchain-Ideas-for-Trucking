# Proof of Transport - Acheiving Consensus By Doing Honest Business

PoW uses a lot of power, but tractors also produce a lot of wasted energy. A 120V DC-to-AC power inverter that is capable of supplying 1500W of power is standard in most tractors. Due to the nature of DC-to-AC conversion, the power is being consumed by the inverter if the 120V outlet has a load on it or not. Because of this, powering miners off of the diesel power plant, AKA engine, while a tractor is under dispatch and going down the road, instead of this PoW scheme wasting energy, it in fact captures normally wasted energy and puts it to use. I believe that if we powered the miners to secure the network with tractors, not only is this PoW scheme carbon-neutral, one could argue it is greener as computing power normally residing in individual data centers could be off-loaded to the tractors that are producing excess energy that is not currently being captured or used.

To acheive consensus using a Proof-of-Work model and not have an "arms race" in hash power on the network, I propose a system where block solutions are only valid while the truck is dispatched on a load and moving. This prevents gaming of the system and keeps the hash rate in check. It also scales naturally with the economy: more transport = better economy = more hashing power on the network to handle the load. Brokerages would essentially rent the hashpower of the trucks the carrier owns while hauling a brokered load. 

Every blockchain needs a base token. A chain's base token is normally distributed via block rewards. By assigning a "cost" to every transaction on the network, a malicious actor could not flood the blockchain with useless transactions (spam). These base tokens have more uses that I will expand upon in another document.

To prevent a malicious actor from just adding extra hash power to the network in order to perform a 51% attack, the fact that block solutions will only be accepted by the other nodes if they come from a valid tractor (will expand upon identity management in another piece) and the nodes of both the shipper and receiver agree that the tractor is actually hauling a load. This secures the chain by making it more beneficial to actually just haul loads legitimately than to try and cheat by buying tractors, creating fake shippers and receivers, creating fake orders, then having to move the trucks from origin to destination to pull off a successfull double-spend attack. 

Not only does this solve the hashpower "arms race" normally seen in PoW blockchains, it also acts as a built-in permissioning system. Hashpower doesn't count unless it is under dispatch. In order for a truck to be under dispatch, you must have a truck, a driver with a CDL, and business relationships with the shipper and receiver. The method of using the act of doing legitimate work as part of the consensus mechanism acts as it's own self-permissioning system.
