# Proof of Transport - Acheiving Consensus By Doing Honest Business

To achieve consensus using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) model and not have an "arms race" in hash power on the network, I propose a system where block solutions are only valid while the truck is dispatched on a load and moving. This prevents gaming of the system and keeps the hash rate in check. It also scales naturally with the economy: more transport = better economy = more hashing power on the network to handle the load. Brokerages would essentially rent the hash power of the trucks the carrier owns while hauling a brokered load.

For this model to work, trucks will need to run miners. Having a miner in a truck would require a constant internet connection and a power source. Most trucks already have the internet connection through their on-board telematics or ELD platform (or smart phone even). Because a Transportation Management System (TMS) could signal to the blockchain that a tractor was under active dispatch, and a 3-way signature transaction between the shipper, receiver, and carrier that can be cryptographically proven, this proof confirms that the transaction is legitimate, the hashing power of the miner in the tractor then begins receiving and hashing blocks of transactions using a PoW algorithm. A combination of sensors in the tractor, which will have digital identities that are owned by the tractor (which has a digital identity) could provide additional proofs to be able to add a block and achieve consensus.

If every tractor runs a miner, must be under active dispatch, and is verified by a 3-way signature for their hashing power to count, the blockchain self-regulates the hashing power of the network. This prevents the "arms race" commonly seen in PoW blockchains. To provide an additional layer of self-permissioning, nodes will be able to choose what other nodes they "trust" in their list of peers (I put "trust" in quotes because everything PoW stands for is "Don't trust, verify.") which means what other nodes will their node listen to transaction broadcasts. If the nodal peer list reflected the same business relationships, only legitimate players who are performing the work can participate.

If an attacker were to try to compromise the security of the chain, the attacker would have to purchase enough tractors to own at least 51% of all tractors, then create fake loads that the attacker would have to get both a "trusted" shipper and "trusted" receiver to sign, dispatch these trucks and then they would have to drive them to the origins and destinations in the fake orders so attacking the chain would be ridiculously expensive and require extremely complex logistics. It is simply more beneficial to just perform legitimate business and is immediately punished (through loss of nodal "trust") buy other nodes removing them as peers. Most nodes would simply ignore the bad actors.

PoW uses a lot of power, but tractors also produce a lot of wasted energy. A 120V DC-to-AC power inverter that is capable of supplying 1500W of power is standard in most tractors. Due to the nature of DC-to-AC conversion, the power is being consumed by the inverter if the 120V outlet has a load on it or not. Because of this, powering miners off the diesel power plant, AKA engine, while a tractor is under dispatch and going down the road, instead of this PoW scheme wasting energy, it in fact captures normally wasted energy and puts it to use. I believe that if we powered the miners to secure the network with tractors, not only is this PoW scheme carbon-neutral, it opens some further possibilities that could make PoW, with decentralized power, carbon-negative.

A side-effect of the fact that hash power doesn't count unless it is under dispatch, and for a truck to be under dispatch, you must have a truck, a driver with a CDL, and business relationships with the shipper and receiver. The method of using the act of doing legitimate work as part of the consensus mechanism acts as it's own self-permissioning system. This "permissioning-through-participation" mechanism even further secures the blockchain while maintaining an open and decentralized, attack-resistant blockchain without the need for a "Gatekeeper" or "Council" who gets to dictate who and who does not get to participate. There is already a permissioning authority, the FMCSA, and there is no need to re-create another layer of bureaucracy in the system.
