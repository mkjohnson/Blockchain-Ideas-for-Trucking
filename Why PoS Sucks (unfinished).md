There is an old saying in business, "There's no such thing as a 'free lunch.'"  Proof-of-Stake is just that: A "digital, online, decentralized, perpetual motion machine." Proof-of-Stake is basically the same as expecting to get this "free lunch" because how much you own is how much voice you get (if this is even a thing), if not, why not just run a database server with distributed instances and agree to store each other's backups. There exists the law of physics called entropy and it just can't be ignored, 
I'll assume everyone understands entropy for this, and if you understand entropy, you will understand why Proof-of-Stake is nothing more than an attempt at creating an online version of a perpetual motion machine. Work(energy, action)  MUST be expended to truly secure a blockchain. "You can't get somethin' for nuttin'," as the old saying goes. The work that miners do to solve these "meaningless puzzles," even though they do not serve a calculatory purpose, they "prove" that they have the answer to the block and if they do, well, that proves they expended the energy (in terms of computing power) is to actually do the work to produce that answer that can be cryptographically verified very easily. This is "Proof-of-Work." There is no way to cheat on this math test. You can't get something from nothing without violating the laws of entropy. This ensures that the "node" that all of the miners contribute their hashpower to solve the block actually participated in the network by helping to secure the transactions of others, and, by acting in the best interests of the network, they not only benefit, but everyone benefits.
Proof-of-Stake hopes that if people hold enough of a blockchain's base tokens, they can be trusted to validate transactions because, "It would be against the staker's interests to do so. I mean, why would one want to wreck one's currency if you hold so much of it, wouldn't it be better to just participate legitimately?" Well, this assumes that people act rationally and that's a serious security flaw. (See: 8 Million Vericoin Hack Prompts Hard Fork to Recover Funds)

Back in 2014, because an attacker was able to steal funds from an exchange, and amass more than the 51% of the tokens to stake, the attacker would then have control of the consensus of the network (because of staking times, this control is not immediate). Vericoin decided to do a "hard fork" and all agree to go back to before the hack. But wait, blockchains are immutable! Data can't be changed! And you are right, but there are no rules that someone could write a new set of rules for the blockchain, get a majority of stake weight to agree to "go back in time" to before the attack and magically all the bad hacker's transactions have been reversed and everyone has their money back, but so do the legitimate users who transacted in those same blocks. This move was highly controversial. Blockchains are supposed to be immutable, (i.e. all transactions are final, even if you screw up), that is the core of how this works.
In 2015, what happened with the ETH/ETC split, was no less controversial when Ethereum decided to hard fork to roll back to the block before the DAO attack (See: The DAO, The Hack, The Soft Fork and The Hard Fork). This split the community into those that supported the roll-back "hard fork" to reverse the transactions and recover the stolen funds adopted the change, and those who did not agree with the roll-back are technically still mining the "Original Ethereum" blockchain (one that does not have the roll-back). This "forkcoin", Ethereum Classic (ETC) continues to be a source of debate even today.
The very fact that the Vericoin and Ethereum hard-fork decisions are able to be "pushed through quickly," and this is because they each have a leader, a "benevolent dictator" that has significant influence over what happens on their blockchains. Well, congratulations! We just mirrored everything that's wrong with the real world in real life. While we're at it, why don't we go ahead and centralize the permissioning of this blockchain too?

What the blockchain offers is security, and security comes at a price. The price is Proof-of-Work. With Proof-of-Work, the only way to achieve consensus by not only doing the work to find a valid block solution
